Although not for most this does give you cash more punch in the markets - but beware of margin calls draining your balance if the markets go against your trade.\nSecurity is very high with their two factor authentication and PGP/GPG encyption. \nFees vary depending on the volume - for main trading pairs this is between 0.1-0.35% - however for other less common crypto pairs the range can be as low as 0.05% or as high as 0.75%.

    "Description" : "BitFinex offers three main functions - it is a pure bitcoin to fiat exchange, a margin trading exchange and a liquidity provider. The platform offers a number of features available that expand the financial positions you can take - for example, the ability to short Bitcoin via margin trading. \nThe exchange also offers a set of other cryptos apart from bitcoin such as Litecoin and Ethereum. \nDeposits and withdrawals take place via the standard bank transfer mean with fees of 0.1% and a minimum of $20. Bitcoin and Litecoin are free.\nBitFinex takes security seriously and has moved from a hot wallet cold wallet set up to segregating customer funds where each user has access to their own wallet which they can review on the blockchain.\nBitfinex was hacked on the 3rd of August 2016 and around 120,000 BTC were stolen.\n",

    "Description" : "Local Bitcoins is a different sort of exchange that allows anyone anywhere to trade. It therefore has the largest amount of markets - although some without much liquidity - for example in Venezuela and other emerging markets. LocalBitcoins works like an open outcry with people in the same location as you - if you want to trade you can place a buy or a sell for a price and wait to be contacted by someone who wants to execute that trade. After agreeing the trade funds are released and held in escrow and depending on the specifics of the local banking system and times for transactions to get confirmed, the trade will eventually be completed. \nThere can be complications which mostly come in the form of couterparty risk - where someone refuses to go ahead with the trade as the price in the market has moved in their favour - so they gain by keeping the bitcoins or USD if they have gone up. Localbitcoins has a dispute resolution system in place to handle these sorts of issues - but on the flipside there is a reputation based system - so you can gauge whether your trading party is reliable or not.\nTrading fees vary and depend on whether you have placed an advert to sell - whereby LocalBitcoins takes a 1% fee. \nIn all a good means to exchange Bitcoin but it doesn't have the razor edge price discovery, and execution time of more traditional order driven exchanges.",

Trading fees also vary depending on the users historic volume - as such trading fees have a broad range of 0-0.5%.\nDeposits and withdrawals come hand in hand with a standard KYC and AML set of procedures - in particular USD withdrawal has a 72 hour locktime - although this can be reduced on request. There are heavy fees for withdrawal at USD 30 and USD 5 for depositing excluding bank surcharges. Euros carry similarly prohibitive surcharges from the exchange whilst withdrawal and deposit fees for Singapore dollars are much lower and better value, either being free or a max of 2 SGD. ",

To put it simply, the more the user trades the lower their trade fees will be.

This means 0.015 BTC will then be added to their 30-day trade volume total.\n\nThe fees for Starter and General accounts are fixed at 0.1% Maker Fee and 0.2% Taker Fee.\n\nTrading fees for upgraded accounts:\n\t\t\t\nTier / 30-days Trading Volume (BTC) / Maker Fee / Taker Fee\n1\t  ≥ 0 BTC\t                                           0.07%      \t0.07%\n2\t  ≥ 10 BTC                                  \t   0.06%      \t0.07%\n3\t  ≥ 100 BTC                              \t   0.05%     \t0.07%\n4\t  ≥ 500 BTC\t                                   0.04%     \t0.07%\n5\t  ≥ 1000 BTC                             \t   0.03%     \t0.06%\n6\t  ≥ 5000 BTC\t                                   0.02%     \t0.06%\n7\t  ≥ 10000 BTC\t                           0.01%     \t0.05%\n8\t  ≥ 20000 BTC\t                                 0%     \t0.04%\n9\t  ≥ 50000 BTC                           \t   -0.01%     \t0.03%\n10\t  ≥ 100000 BTC                          \t   -0.01%\t        0.02%\n\nIf you're a professional trader and wish to discuss a personalized fee structure with HitBTC they'd be keen to talk.

Since then, their product has evolved a lot but they kept the same management team.\nIn 2010, they changed their name to “The Rock Trading”, with a division dedicated to managing funds and an exchange to trade currencies and stocks.\nIn June 2011, the first Bitcoin was traded on The Rock Trading, making it one of the oldest exchanges still alive! As the website continued to grow, they started to add new currencies (such as Litecoin, Namecoin and others) and in May 2013 they became a Ripple gateway and an official XRP reseller.\nJuly 2013 marks another important change for The Rock Trading: it became a certified Limited Liability Company, registered in Malta and founded by Andrea Medri (CFO) and Davide Barbieri (CTO), two entrepreneurs well known in the Italian Bitcoin community. Jumio (Safe Harbor Act certification) handles the steps needed to complete the verification of the customers in the fastest and safest way possible. They established an agreement with one of the safest Bitcoin wallets in the industry, GreenAddress: their exchange uses only multisig addresses and it allows zero-confirmation Bitcoin deposits, making it even faster to transfer the funds from your wallet to The Rock Trading. Another useful resource for clients is a prepaid card that can be ordered by every verified customer and can be loaded directly from the exchange, with the funds held on it.",

We gave you the right to decide whether you want to be with us in our Crypto Exchange journey by accepting the changes.\nMuch to our regret, after this step Liqui is no longer able to provide liquidity for the Users left. We also do not see any economic point in providing you with our services. However, we do not want to return to where we were a month ago. Hence, we decided to close all accounts and stop providing our services. It broke our hearts to do that.\nYou will be able to withdraw your Digital Assets through our website within 30 days after this message was sent. If you did not withdraw delisted Digital Assets since we announced changes in our policies, you will also have another 30 days from the date this message is sent.\nAfter 30 days we cannot guarantee that we will be maintaining our website. In this case, all withdrawals will be processed through our support https://liqui.freshdesk.com until the last user store his assets with us. Note that our Terms of Use will apply until you have your more than zero balance in our wallets. If we do not provide services we cannot store your assets for free, so the fee will apply if you fail to withdraw in accordance with our Terms of Use.\nWe may be back soon. However, that depends on the market which has significantly changed since 2017. We do not know what else to say but say thank you for supporting the cryptocurrency community and your faith in us.\nWe want to finish this message by the phrase of Marianne Williamson - \"Every ending is a new beginning. Through the grace of God, we can always start again\".\nYour Liqui Team",

    "Description" : "ExtStock is a multi-cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to trade multiple cryptocurrency-based assets and fiat currencies. The ExtStock exchange is based in the U.K. and features a 0.2% trading fee. \n[SCAM Alert] ExtStock Overview by Cointelligence\n\"UPDATE May 5, 2020: In early April of 2020, reports began to surface of ExtStock holding user funds and refusing to allow withdrawals. When customers attempted a withdrawal they were told that their account was frozen due to \"suspicious activity.\" One user was told that a Romanian police officer had requested that they take \"necessary measures\" against their account. The user in question had absolutely no ties to Romania. Other users have reported a similar pattern of \"suspicious activity\" and police requests.\nDuring this time, the exchange has continued to tweet and otherwise display normal online activity. Users who have attempted to complain on Twitter have found their accounts blocked.\nIn researching this exchange, we found that the company registered as the operator of this exchange in the UK is Exchange Cloud Limited, and the person in control of that company is Oluwasegun Oni. A review of his LinkedIn shows an extensive work history but no mention of this exchange. If the exchange was as successful as they claim, we would expect him to proudly display it in his work history! That said, our research did not turn up any other suspicious behavior on his part, so far.\nExtStock is also accused of reporting inflated volume. Their bitcoin price is higher than on other exchanges, which is inspiring users to transfer their funds to the exchange in hopes of selling at a profit, only to find their BTC locked into the exchange due to the aforementioned accusations of \"suspicious activity.\"\nWhile we cannot find conclusive proof that ExtStock is planning an exit scheme or suffering from a lack of reserves, we do find their behavior concerning enough to mark it as a SCAM and warn users not to transfer their funds to this exchange.\"",

    "Description" : "Uniswap v1 is an on-chain system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, implementing an automated liquidity protocol based on a “constant product formula”. Each Uniswap v1 pair stores pooled reserves of two assets, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a 30-basis-point fee on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. The contracts are non-upgradeable.\nUniswap v2 is a new implementation based on the same formula, with several new highly-desirable features. Most significantly, it enables the creation of arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, rather than supporting only pairs between ERC20 and ETH. It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on Ethereum to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals. Finally, it enables “flash swaps” where users can receive assets freely and use them elsewhere on the chain, only paying for (or returning) those assets at the end of the transaction.",

Most significantly, it enables the creation of arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, rather than supporting only pairs between ERC20 and ETH. It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on Ethereum to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals. Finally, it enables “flash swaps” where users can receive assets freely and use them elsewhere on the chain, only paying for (or returning) those assets at the end of the transaction.",

Therefore, the maker fee is the fee charged to traders who place a bid order at a price lower than the last traded price or place an ask order above the last traded price.\n\nA taker is someone who places orders that are immediately fulfilled before they go to the order book and decrease the market depth by taking orders from the order book. Therefore, the taker fee is primarily charged to traders placing market orders and may be charged to some traders who place limit orders.\n\nNote: Fees are subject to change during trading fee events\n\nThe withdrawal fee is fixed at 0.0004 BTC regardless of the withdrawal amount\n\nFor more detailed information regarding fees, please visit the following links:\nhttps://help.mycoinstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040572732-Maker-Taker-Fee\nhttps://help.mycoinstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/900002213006-Withdraw-from-MCS",
