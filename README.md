PyCoin is an automated cryptocurrency trading application. Right now it is just a pet project, but will hopefully become more than that soon. It consists of two parts – intermarket arbitrage, and intramarket arbitrage. Both are very much a work in progress.

## Intermarket

This side of pycoin will scan given markets for each's crypto price, make a decision on the greatest difference between the two, buy at the lowest, and sell at the highest – all with in the same moment.

## Intramarket

An automated speed trading algorithm for cryprocurrency using LSTM. Cryptocurrency was chosen over the stock market due to the limits on trading frequency with less than $25K in your portfolio. The goal of this algorithm is to predict with >51% a gain or loss on bitcoin within the second and then make a trade based on that data.
